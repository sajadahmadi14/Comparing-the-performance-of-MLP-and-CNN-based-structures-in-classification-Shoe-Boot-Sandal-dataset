# Comparing-the-performance-of-MLP-and-CNN-based-structures-in-classification-Shoe-Boot-Sandal-dataset
Implementing two different types of neural networks - MLP and CNN - for solving a classification task using the sandal boots dataset. The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of these two network architectures in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

The sandal boots dataset consists of numerous images of sandals and boots, which are categorized into different classes based on their type and style. This project aims to classify these images accurately using machine learning algorithms, specifically MLP and CNN structures.

The repository includes code for preprocessing the dataset, building both MLP and CNN models, training them with the preprocessed data, evaluating their performance on a test set, and comparing their results. Additionally, it also include visualizations and graphs to demonstrate the differences in performance between the two models.
